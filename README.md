# national_generation_capacity_stacked
This dataset appears to contain information about installed capacity in megawatts (MW) for various technologies and countries over different years. Here's a breakdown of the columns:

    ID: Unique identifier for each entry.
    Technology: The type of technology for the power generation (e.g., Fossil fuels).
    Source: The source of the data (e.g., e-control, TSO Bulgaria, BFE, UN Statistical Office).
    Source_type: The type of the data source (e.g., Regulatory Authority, Transmission System Operator, Statistical Office).
    Weblink: Web link to the source document or data.
    Year: The year for which the data is recorded.
    Type: Type of capacity measurement (e.g., Installed capacity in MW).
    Country: The country to which the data pertains (e.g., AT for Austria, BG for Bulgaria, CH for Switzerland).
    Capacity_definition: Definition of capacity measurement (e.g., Gross capacity, Net capacity).
    Capacity: The actual capacity value in megawatts.
    Comment: Any additional comments or notes.
    Energy_source_level_0 to Energy_source_level_3: Columns indicating the energy source levels.
    Technology_level: Level of technology.

It seems like the data mainly focuses on installed capacity for fossil fuel-based power generation in various countries over different years, sourced from different regulatory authorities, transmission system operators, and statistical offices.
